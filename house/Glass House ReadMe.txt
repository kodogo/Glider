Glass House has (for no particular reason) a window in each of its 62 rooms.  In addition, there are a number of unusual features to this house including the Giant Loop-The-Loop, the Split-Level Rooms, The Ring of Fire, and the insidious Cage Rooms.  I enjoy designing houses that are fun (not impossible) to play, with a fair amount of surprises, puzzling situations, and visually interesting layouts, and without an overdose of death traps, massive air raids, and clutters of obstacles.  Try out my other house designs on AOL: Five Great Houses.  All of these scenerios are even more with my Glider 4.06 custom art file: FunArt, also available on AOL.                                                                   WardHarten
