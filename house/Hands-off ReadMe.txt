This revised version of Hands-off House fixes a minor design flaw that causes the glider to occasionally get fried in room #13.  If you have the original version of Hands-Off House,  you can make the correction yourself by opening it with the Room Editor and changing the delay time for the left electrical outlet in room #13 from 100 to 110.Hands-off House is a 40 room Glider house that actually PLAYS ITSELF!  That's right, you don't have to touch a button to flawlessly navigate through some of the most entertaining room set-ups you've ever seen.  This is not a demo on how to play Glider; it is a carefully constructed house using all the familiar objects and elements, but designed in such a way that all you have to do is load the game and sit back and watch!  You'll see the glider brave flame and spark, pass between deadly obstacles with microns to spare, and collect every bonus before completing the house.  AND IT NEVER CRASHES!  This house has some very unusual situations: multiple pathways, circuitous stairways, and recursive patterns, as well as some little oddities like candles that don't burn, outlets that don't shock, and balls that don't bounce.  Because the glider's flight path is predetermined by the room set-ups, I have been able to make it do things that it never does in normal play.  The result is a very intriguing bit of entertainment for Glider fans.  I also have intentionally left this file unlocked so that you may explore the rooms with the Room Editor to find out how certain effects are achieved or to modify room set-ups for your own use.Hands-off House runs flawlessly on my LC II with 32 mhz accellerator.   If you notice a performance problem on your Mac (like the glider crashing or bumping an object) I'd like to know about it, since I am assuming it will perform comparably on Macs of various speeds (all the dynamics of the game SHOULD be affected equally by the machine speed). One additional note: although the glider flies the same route each time, scores may vary slightly because of the random behavior in "open window" rooms.  (Now I suppose someone will try to get a high score by "goosing" the glider through certain rooms where time bonuses can be improved, but I don't condone this, and anyway there are no batteries offered until the very end of the house.)                                                                                                     WardHarten                                                                        (Ward Hartenstein, Rochester, NY)P.S.  Hands-off House looks especially cool with "FunArt" or "FunArt Deluxe", my custom art files for Glider 4.06.
