House of Doom is suitable for those who have completed the house that came with the game and are looking for a new challenge. It's comparable in difficulty to the 2nd half of the original house.Hints:¥	Use battery power sparingly. You need a decent amount to finish.¥	Be very careful going through the last room, as a wrong move can get you into serious difficulty, even with a lot of extra planes.Questions, Comments:AOL: JeffrC[ This is a busy house!
