The Story of The House Full of Stuff Next DoorI got through The House Full of Stuff, and so did a lot of other people. Some people thought some of the rooms, especially early on, were too hard. Others, mainly me, who had gone through it a few times, thought some of the rooms were getting to be too boring. And then there were the people who actually found flaws in some of the rooms.The answer to all of these problems: The House Full of Stuff Next Door. A replica of the original House Full of Stuff, built right next door to the original, but with a variety of improvements and surprises, including lots of new rooms. I wouldn't try this one until completing the original House Full of Stuff. First, House Full of Stuff Next Door is harder. Second, if you try House Full of Stuff first, you can jot down all of the problems and complaints you have with the original, and then get a special thrill as you count how many of them are solved, answered, and/or eliminated in the new version.Hints:¥	Hints for House Full of Stuff still apply.¥	Many rooms look exactly like the old versions, but be careful, slight alteration could spell disaster.Questions, Comments:AOL: JeffrC
