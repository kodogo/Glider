Usher House - 		I’m one of the many starving 14 year olds who got up to his ears in debt to purchase Glider...  It was well worth it.  I’ve been using Mac’s for seven years, six years of which were with an Original Macintosh, with a few upgrades (Do you remember those 128k machines?).  Currently I’m using a Mac IIsi.  This house was written one lonely evening when I’d gotten bored with houses that were NICE to the people in them.  It originally had no gliders, batteries, rubber bands, or bonuses of any kind.  I didn’t just smother people with a dozen shredders in every room, but I came pretty darn close to it.  It was, of course, nearly impossible to complete.  I toned down the horror a little bit, and added some food in strategic places, which usually takes off more than it gives.  When you try to complete the house, remember to use the time-honored practice of getting through fast, then going back for the goodies.   It’s now a 30 room house, with a good 100,000 points if you complete it.  Have fun!  Any and all comments are welcome.

Be warned.  Also, some of the rooms are very busy - on a slow Mac it may feel sluggish. - john]
