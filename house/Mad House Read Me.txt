Welcome to the Mad House!This is a very difficult house to get through.  I don't want to spoil it too much with a lot of hints, but I will reveal that the house is something of a maze.  There are many, many rooms where you have several ways you can go.  Some directions lead to certain entrapment and no return.  Other directions lead to the way out.  There are many ways to get through the house but an equal number of ways you can go in which you most certainly will not get through.  A final hint: there are a lot of tough rooms where timing is VERY critical.  This house is for the people who thought the original house (The House) was too easy.  Good luck!john calhoun-
