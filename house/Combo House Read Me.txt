What is Combo House?This is the original house that came with Glider 4.0 ("The House" & "The House 2") combined with "Mad House" & "Mad House 2" (renamed "Combo House" through "Combo House 4").  As you may remember, the last room in the original house presented you with an open window and a way out of the house.  That has been changed in "Combo House" and that room now takes you to the beginning of "Mad House".  Why on earth would someone want to do this?  Well, because this hybrid house has over 120 rooms!  By flying right out of the original house and into the new house, your "score potential" is quite large indeed!  But to lessen some of the confusion, the houses were renamed "Combo House".  Score big!
