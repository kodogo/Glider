Dear Glider 4.0 Fans,Hello, my name is Tony Korlath and I designed Lumpy's Home.  This was my first experience with using the Editor program and it worked quite nicely.  Lumpy's Home took me about 3 hours to design.  The fun part about designing your own home is that you can make it as hard or as easy as you would like.  There is a least one hidden room, and I hope that you can find it.Good Luck and Happy Gliding,Tony Korlath
